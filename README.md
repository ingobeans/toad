# TOAD, the web browser of your dreams*
<sup>*dreams may possibly be nightmares</sup>

TOAD is a CLI web browser written in Rust. It is built from the ground up with a hand written HTML and CSS parser. This is not a positive lmao

TOAD does not support JavaScript, and never will. It does however, to a limited degree, support CSS styling. It also supports images! (albeit downscaled so much they become pixel art)

Most pages will probably not look good in TOAD, or even load, so here's a list of tested websites that (mostly) work:
- [SerenityOS](https://serenityos.org/)
- [DuckDuckGo](https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/) (searching works but the homescreen is kind of jank)
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) (not the homepage)
